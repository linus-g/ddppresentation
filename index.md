## Introduction

Comparing inequality of different income distributions is associated with a number of problems. For example, different measures of inequality will rank income distributions differently,
and distributions that are very different can often have the same value for some inequality measures. The purpose of this application is to allow the user to compare different income distributions, by:

- Generating two separate income distributions
- Comparing measures of inequality for the two distributions
- Plot the income distributions and Lorenz curves

## Future extensions

- Allow the user to choose which distributions to draw random samples from
- Add more control of distributions
- Add additional measures of income inequality
- Add possibility to make comparison with actual data by selected countries
